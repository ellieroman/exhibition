			<h1> World History-Coding The Past!</h1>
				<p> In World history we were able to interview someone who we personally areb close to  or is influentual to us. The person I chose to do was my mom. We learned different ways to view their past and knowing how to incorporate it in different ways that helped us view it in our own way. Down below will let you view and learn the different ways that helped us create this project.</p>
