	<p> In each page you will recognize the project's we were able to create with all the content with a little information and supporting images, about each project and how we were able to create each one. Coding the Past, is based on introducing someone we knew very well and being able to see the past of our interviewee and present day now. A timely solution is our second project it was more based on the postive and negative afftects in the Industrial Revolution.</p>
